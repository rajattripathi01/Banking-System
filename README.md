# SmartBank (Console-Based Banking System)

SmartBank is a simple **console-based banking system** implemented in Java.  
It allows users to **create bank accounts, log in using a security PIN, deposit money, withdraw money, and record transaction history**, all stored in `.txt` files (no database).

The project is designed to demonstrate:
- User input validation
- File-based data persistence
- Basic object-oriented banking logic
